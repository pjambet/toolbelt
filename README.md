Toolbelt
========

This project aims to be a platform where people share publicly their "toolbelt". It principally targets developers, but could eventually be used in other contexts.
The "toolbelt" designates any kind of tool you user to do your job, or any tool you just like.

Example of my "toolbelt" :

- MacOS
- iTerm2
- brew
- vim
- List of my vim plugins
- the_silver_searcher
- mailcatcher
- postman REST Client
- etc ...

Some are mainstream, some less, that's the point of this project !
